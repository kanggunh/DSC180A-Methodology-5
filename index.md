B11: Professor David Fenning


**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
It has been interesting to see that there are a lot of other labs doing the same things for their domain. Our mentors were telling us that there is a lab working on batteries who were also looking into literature mining to be able to efficiently choose their target of experiment.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
We are planning to extract information and create a database that could then recommend some molecules in the lab to be able to test. This will allow for the people in this field to not waste time testing already known molecules but can further speed up the research of this field by testing new things that are expected to work better.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
We initially focused so much on LLMs being our answer to classify literature when something as simple as TF-IDF vectors are already good for the task. If I were to change the approach, I would tell myself to not overlook the basic models and build on top of work that has been proven to a working method of doing the task.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would love to see the use of more visualization. Because our project is very focused on mining data, I think we have not visualized too many things. I want to make sure that our end product makes sense to whoever we present to using words and the appropriate visualization tools.
